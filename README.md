# Editify 

The WebGPU Editor (vulkan for desktop)


## Why another Editor?

1. It's Webgpu based which is already fast but has ability to be a web editor.
2. The desktop app uses vulkan instead of opengl (which zed uses)
3. It includes a plugin system with wasm which any plugin can be built in any langauge
4. LSP & Treesitter support out of the door compared to vscode where you have to install additional extensions for lsp [REPO]()
5. It has builtin plugins such as Discord Rich Presence, Vim Mode & More.
6. It's based on community decisions.
7. It fully based in Rust.
8. It's free and opensource.

## How to install?
